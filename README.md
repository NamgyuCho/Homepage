<h2><b>Bio</b></h2>

<h3>I am a Ph.D. student at Korea University, advised by <a href="http://pr.korea.ac.kr/sub2_1.php?code=LSW">Prof. Seong-Whan Lee</a> (and <a href="www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille">Prof. Alan Yuille</a> for the first three years). My research interests are computer vision and machine learning. My current focus is applying deep learning for remote sening image understanding. Previously I worked on human behavior understanding including 3D human pose tracking, individual action and group activity recognition.<br><br>
  
  Over the course of my Ph.D. I participated in several projects: human behavior understanding using the Kinect sensor at Korea University (2010 - now), human body parsing at Korea University (2011 - 2013), constructing a large scale dataset at Korea University and UCLA (2011 - 2014), geometry estimation and perceptual organization methods for assisting visually impaired people at UCLA (2013 - 2014), and deep learning-based remote sensing image understanding at Korea University (2016 - now).</h3>
